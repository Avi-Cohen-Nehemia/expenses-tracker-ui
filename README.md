## Reflection

### Tech Stack Choice
I love React and managing state with Redux and although I've been using these technologies for a while, I was still challenged in multiple ways during this project. My only regret is that I did not choose to use React Hooks to build my components, it's an aspect of React that I definitely plan to explore in the future.

### Planning
I think this project was planned fairly well. I set myself goals, I wrote down the steps to achieve them and I followed through. Some decisions I've made during planning turned out to be somewhat questionable but the fact that I dedicated adequate time for that made it much easier to correct any mistakes that I made.

### Favorite Parts
Being able to successfully integrate 3rd party libraries like Sweetalert or ES-Lint. It is always a bit daunting and frustrating to start reading the documentation to a new piece of technology I have never used before, but when I manage to achieve what I wanted to do with them it is very rewarding.

### Least Favorite Parts
I can't really say anything on the front-end was particularly frustrating but the thing I most struggled with was to try and make the app responsive on all screen sized.
